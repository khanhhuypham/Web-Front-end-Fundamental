        <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p>
        <p class="p2">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, 
            how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, 
            different displays for differet devices and screen sizes and much more!</p>

            <b>Tip:</b>
            The world <b> cascading</b> meanns that a style applied to a parent element willl also apply to all
            children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings
            , paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify
            something else)!
